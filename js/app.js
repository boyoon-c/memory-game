// Create shuffle button
// Attach event listener to the button that invokes a function that uses randomized number to create different combination of a card array
// Each player flips three cards at a time
// Create player turn that alternates turns when multiples-of-three clicks are made
// See if there is a match
// Assign type to each card 
// Compare the type of the flipped cards
// If there is no match: Make all the cards flip downward
// If there is a match: Remove the matched cards from the board
// Track each playerâ€™s performance by counting the number of matches that a player found
// Create restart button to allow players to reset the game or reshuffle the cards
// If players found all the matches, show the message to reveals who is the winner
